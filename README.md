Computer Vision PID Control
In partial requirements of ECED4402 - Real Time Systems

To demonstrate a responsive real-time system, we researched several real time systems and decided to make a computer vision PID Controlled ping-pong ball balancer. A basic requirement will be to balance a ball at any position on a tiltable table and to be able to guide the ball from any position at rest to the set position. We are hoping that this will even be responsive enough to “catch” a ball that is tossed onto the table with minimal bounce. There of course would be limitations to this, depending on the speed of the ball and how it bounces. We only plan to work on two dimensions but someday this could be modified to detect the 3D position of the ball.
